                <p>A little about me is love being outdoors and connecting with nature through hikes, walks, and other outside activites.
      In my free time I like playing basketball, playing video games, and listening to music. I am currently a freshman at Behrend 
      and hope to continue being here for the next four years. I am curretnly a DIGIT major but am switching into communications
      soon as I came to find out I don't exactly like coding nor enjoy it too much. Although I do think that some of it is useful
   and important that I learn and understand it for future use.</p>
