        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>As a new learner to html there were many challenges that I dealt with. I think the most difficult part was trying to make sure everything would actually appear on the 
            website and in the correct place. I am still having trouble as a lot of code I typed won't even appear. I personally like wordpress better as I came to find out I dislike coding 
            very much and it is diffiucult to understand, while wordpress was much more beginner friendly.(you can view my wordpress <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/lwetzel/"> here</a>). With the wordpress site there wasnt too much difficulty getting everything 
            alligned and where I wanted it, while html was a pain in my butt and I still don't have everything where I want it. The skills you need for html is you need to have a understanding
            of code before you even go into the class and need to be somewhat good with laptops and I was never either of those before this class. But as I was saying the wordpress was 
            much easier for begginers like myself to make a websites. Some skills I want to improve is definitly understanding the code more and understanding what I need for everything
            to look good.</p>
