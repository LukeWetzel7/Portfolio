        <h1>My text analyst </h1>
        <p>For the documents I chose to anaylize, I chose Benjamin Harrison's 1890 State of the Union and Herbet Hoover's 1930 State of the Union
        to compare and contrast the two. During Harrison's term he was more concerned about building the economy and making sure the country is stable as a whole through agriculture 
        and reforming. While Hoover's was concerned about making sure the country doesn't fall into a depression (although it did) and he was concerned about public confidence with the 
        country being in a recession he tried helping with relief efforts and public works while they both failed. The reason I chose these two presidents was, Benjamin Harrison was th first
        and only president to be a member of the Delta Chi Fraternity and Herbert Hoover well just because and I thouhgt he got dealt a bad hand.</p>
    <h2>Harrison's State of the union</h2>
    <img src="images/Screenshot%202025-04-14%20234040.png"></img>
        <p>In Harriosn's he addresses the Congress and its mainly about ecomomic reforming and to sustain it through agriculture 
            as our economy was a big concern in 1890. Harrison also uses United States quite a bit and uses that term to describe what other countries think about us as war is also a big
        possibility in this time and very prevelant in the mind of a president. As mentioned earlier he mentions addresses congress a lot too and refers back to the last session they had
        and ask congress to help strengthen our relationship with European countries as well to help prevent war or creates allies if anything were to happen.</p>
    <h2>Hoover's State of the Union</h2>
    <img src="images/Screenshot%202025-04-14%20234215.png"/>
    <p>In Hoover's he addresses the Congress as he was trying to seek funding to hopefully get our economy back on track as the great depression was hitting
    the states hard. And to hopefully restore public confidence as the whole country was looking rough. Hoover's era was also experiencing a major drought which caused a lot of the agriculture 
    to die and wither which most of the farmers weren't producing food which meant most of the country wasn't able to get a lot of food. Hoover also needed a lot of funding for the hoover dam
    which also set the economy back even farther as the US simply didn't have that type of funding.</p>
        <h2>Here is a compare and contrast of both cirrus's to tell which words are the most commonly found between the two.</h2>
        <img src="images/Screenshot%202025-04-14%20235214.png" />
        <p>Although both speeches were about 40 years apart the country was still facing some of the same challenges in both, through
        economic reform and stability. And through the possibilty of war with both as well as agricultural challenges with both. Both speeches addressed the congress for funding and
        for advise on how to move forward with foreign relations and diplomatic efforts.</p>
        <h2>Here is harrison's 1892 state of the union and how it compares to his 1890 one.</h2>
        <img src="images/Screenshot%202025-04-23%20124117.png"></img><img src="images/Screenshot%202025-04-23%20124435.png"></img>
        <p>In Harrison's 1890 speech he was speaking more towards congress while his 1892 speech he was more addressing the United States as a whole and dropped them a total of
        16 times in his 1892 speech and its funny to note that he dropped the prhase of the United States a total of 16 times again in his speech in his 1890 speech while he was more 
        focused on the congress in the earlier one he was still talking about the Unites States as a whole in both.</p>
