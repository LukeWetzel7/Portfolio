        <p>For the documents I chose to anaylize, I chose Benjamin Harrison's 1890 State of the Union and Herbet Hoover's 1930 State of the Union

    <p>In Hoover's he addresses the Congress as he was trying to seek funding to hopefully get our economy back on track as the great depression was hitting
    the states hard. And to hopefully restore public confidence as the whole country was looking rough.</p>

        <p>Although both speeches were about 40 years apart the country was still facing some of the same challenges in both, through
        economic reform and stability.</p>
