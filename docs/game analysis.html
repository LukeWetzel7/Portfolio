        <h2>Initial thoughts</h2>
        <p>Everything is a game where you are a new employee at a video game developing company named Nomina. While at the company you are a video game tester and go through
        the life of a new employee fresh out of college experiencing adult life for the first time. In the game you read and click through the dialoge then choose different phrases
        based on how you personally feel or see things and based on what you say there are different outcomes. Depending on what you say you can earn points from different co workers 
        which means whatever you picked they connected also with it the most, and it's basically you getting to know that co worker the best.</p>

        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p>The main characters that you interact with are; Amelia,Olive,Ren,Noel,Donovan,Yosef,Elizabeth,and Mr.Clark. All of them work for Nomina and/or are either your coworkers or boss 
        and you choose dialog depending on what the characters said or depending on what you feel. Each character has a certain personality assigned to them and each gets mentioned 
        multiple times throughout. For example Noel likes art alot and does the art design for the games, and Olive is into music and she makes the music for each game so its personalities 
        like that. Outside of that you don't get much more in depth in the characters backstories. Most of the characters go along very good together and seem like good friends in the game. </p>

        <h2>Textures and Game music</h2>
        <p>The texture of the game is the charactors are pixalated and the background are pixalated pictures of Behrend which I thought was really cool. The text is really easy to read as 
        well and same with the answer boxes. The music is really good I think as well and fits the theme, plus in the top corner it list the song name and artist.</p>

        <h2>What is the Theme</h2>
        <p>When first playing the game you're a new hire as a video game tester for a game company named Nomina. At first you start out normal and go through each learning more about games
        and your coworkers. While further in the game you realize your job and the game industry as a whole has a hidden issue with it. As you progress in the game you realize that another department
        the workers are getting overworked and a bit underpaid. Even further in the game you realize the women in the company are getting kinda harassed by some men in other departments. What the game 
        is trying to show is that although the game industry seems like a fun place for a career it can still be a scary place not even for women but it can happen to men as well.</p>
