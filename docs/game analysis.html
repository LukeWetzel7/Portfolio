        <h2>Initial thoughts</h2>
        <p>Everything is a game where you are a new employee at a video game developing company named Nomina. While at the company you are a video game tester and go through
        the life of a new employee fresh out of college experiencing adult life for the first time. In the game you read and click through the dialoge then choose different phrases
        based on how you personally feel or see things and based on what you say there are different outcomes. Depending on what you say you can earn points from different co workers 
        which means whatever you picked they connected also with it the most, and it's basically you getting to know that co worker the best.</p>
