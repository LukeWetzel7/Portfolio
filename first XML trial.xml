<Joesmells>For the simplest of all slime recipes, all you need is <ingrediant>cornstarch</ingrediant>. <step n="1">Just dump <ingrediant>some</ingrediant>
        into a bowl</step>, <step num="1">add some <ingrediant>water</ingrediant></step>, <step>&amp; start mixing</step>.<!--I like smelling farts--> <step>Keep
        adding water until it reaches the consistency you want (a good place to start is 2 parts
        cornstarch to 1 part water)</step>. You can also add food coloring to make it look more
